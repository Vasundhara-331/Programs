    int diff = a-b;
    return sum,diff;
}

/*
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
Sum of a and b is 8
Difference of a and b is 8
EXPLANATION:
Since only one value can be returned using return statement, only one output is obtained.
Comma (,) operator follows left to right associativity. Hence from left to right, diff is the operation that comes at the right end. 
Hence answer of diff is returned to both print statements.
